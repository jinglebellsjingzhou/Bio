# Bio 
I am a language teacher and researcher who is passionate about language teaching. My research focus on how to enhance L2 learnersâ€™ motivation, reduce their classroom anxiety, and improve different aspects of their language proficiency, including but not limited to Chinese character recognition, vocabulary knowledge, syntactic awareness, morphological awareness and reading fluency.  My specialization includes second language teaching, second language reading, extensive reading, research methodology, and teaching Chinese and English as foreign languages.

I serve as the review editor for the peer-reviewed journal Reading in a Foreign Language.
